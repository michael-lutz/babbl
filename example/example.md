# Introduction

This is a **research paper** that demonstrates the capabilities of the *babbl* markdown renderer.

## Code Examples

Here's some Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def analyze_data(data):
    """Analyze the given dataset."""
    mean = np.mean(data)
    std = np.std(data)
    return mean, std

# Example usage
data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
mean, std = analyze_data(data)
print(f"Mean: {mean:.3f}, Std: {std:.3f}")
```

## Mathematical Content

The algorithm achieves O(n log n) time complexity, which is quite efficient for our use case.
